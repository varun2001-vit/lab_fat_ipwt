    <p>The architecture for the <em class="test">phishing detection model</em> involves several steps. First, the dataset is preprocessed through label encoding to convert categorical features into numerical values. Next, stemming is applied to reduce words to their base or root form. Then, lemmatization is performed to group together inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Several models are trained on the training set, including logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine. The models are then evaluated on the testing set to determine their accuracy in detecting phishing websites. Finally, the best performing model is selected and used to classify websites as prone to phishing attacks or not based on their features.</p>
